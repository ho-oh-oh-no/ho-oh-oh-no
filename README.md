## Why hello there, welcome to the _✨Legendarily Fails✨_ account

Hi, I'm a frontend dev who does weird things then they crash and burn.

Right now I have a few things up.

1. Cod, a ROM download page. [Linkie Here](https://ho-oh-oh-no.github.io/Cod/)
1. Webtro, a fork from [BinBashBanana](https://github.com/BinBashBanana) and I'm going to tweak it later. [Linkie here](https://ho-oh-oh-no.github.io/webretro/)
